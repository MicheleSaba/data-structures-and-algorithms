# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Reverse an array without using any javascript array methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

We decided to implement a for-loop that would swap the values of the first and last index in the array.
We chose this approach because it seemed efficient for the problem.
This program with run a loop for half the size of the array.

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

# Linked-Lists Insertion

## Challenge

Insert nodes into linked lists, before & after value and append.

## Approach & Efficiency

We decided to use a while loop on all three approaches. To append, we iterated through the array until we found the last value and then inserted the new value at the last iteration.
