# Reverse an Array

## Challenge

Reverse an array without using any javascript array methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

We decided to implement a for-loop that would swap the values of the first and last index in the array.
We chose this approach because it seemed efficient for the problem.
This program with run a loop for half the size of the array.

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
